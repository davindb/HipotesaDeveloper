## Open Endpoints

Our APIs are open endpoints and require **no authentication**

- [Predict](#disease-prediction) : `POST /api/predict/`
- [Diseases List](#diseases-list) : `GET /api/diseases/`
- [Symptoms List](#symptoms-list) : `GET /api/symptoms/`

## Disease Prediction

Used to predict a disease based on the symptoms from user inputs.

**URL** : `/api/predict/`

**Method** : `POST`

**Auth required** : NO

**Data constraints**

```json
{
  "symptom_1": "[valid symptom <str>]",
  "symptom_2": "[valid symptom <str>]",
  "symptom_3": "[valid symptom <str>]"
}
```

**Data example**

```json
{
  "symptom_1": "itching",
  "symptom_2": "nodal_skin_eruptions",
  "symptom_3": "skin_rash"
}
```

We recommend you to put at least three key value pairs for getting the most accurate results.

Valid symptom means the symptom that is existed in our database. You can see what symptoms are existed in our database by following the instruction on calling a [Symptoms List](#symptoms-list) request.

### Success Response

**Code** : `200 OK`

**Content example**

```json
{
  "Description": "In humans, fungal infections occur when an invading fungus takes over an area of the body and is too much for the immune system to handle. Fungi can live in the air, soil, water, and plants. There are also some fungi that live naturally in the human body. Like many microbes, there are helpful fungi and harmful fungi.",
  "Disease": "Fungal infection",
  "Precaution": [
    "bath twice",
    "use detol or neem in bathing water",
    "keep infected area dry",
    "use clean cloths"
  ],
  "Probability": 96.66658639907837
}
```

### Error Response

**Condition** : If type of the value is not a string.

**Code** : `400 BAD REQUEST`

**Content** :

```json
{
  "ErrorMessage": "TypeError: <value> is expected to be string but got <class 'int'>."
}
```

## Diseases List

Used to get the list of diseases.

**URL** : `/api/diseases/`

**Method** : `GET`

**Auth required** : NO

### Success Response

**Code** : `200 OK`

**Content example**

```json
[
    {
        "Description": "In humans, fungal infections occur when an invading fungus takes over an area of the body and is too much for the immune system to handle. Fungi can live in the air, soil, water, and plants. There are also some fungi that live naturally in the human body. Like many microbes, there are helpful fungi and harmful fungi.",
        "Disease": "Fungal infection",
        "Id": 0,
        "Precautions": [
            "bath twice",
            "use detol or neem in bathing water",
            "keep infected area dry",
            "use clean cloths"
        ]
    },
    ...

```

## Symptoms List

Used to get the list of symptoms.

**URL** : `/api/symptoms/`

**Method** : `GET`

**Auth required** : NO

### Success Response

**Content example**

```json
[
    {
        "Id": 0,
        "Symptom": "abdominal_pain"
    },
    {
        "Id": 1,
        "Symptom": "abnormal_menstruation"
    },
    ...

## Perform Queries on Request

These are the available properties to perform queries.

| Property     | Type            | Description                                                   |
| :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `where`      | key-value pairs | Specify which field you want to retrieve from the collection. |
| `order`      | string          | Sort order for your data based on the field you specified.    |
| `limit`      | integer         | Limit the number of object you want to retrieve.              |
| `descending` | boolean         | Sort the retrieved data in descending order.                  |

### Valid field for Diseases Collection

- Id <value: int>
- Disease <value: str>
- Description <value: str>
- Precautions <value: array>

### Valid field for Symptoms Collection

- Id <value: int>
- Symptom <value: str>

`where` is to specify which field you want to retrieve.

**Data constraints**

```json
{
  "where": {
    "[valid field]": "[valid value <str> or <int>]"
  }
}
```

**Data example**

```json
{
  "where": {
    "Id": 3
  }
}
```

Based on the example, I will retrieve the data which the **'Id'** is **3**.

You can also perform an `OR` condition using array as a type of the value.

**Data example**

```json
{
  "where": {
    "Disease": ["Fungal infection", "Allergy", "AIDS"]
  }
}
```

Then, you will retrieve any data that satisfied the values.

`order` is for sorting your data based on the field you specified.

**Data constraints**

```json
{
  "order": "[valid field <str>]"
}
```

**Data example**

```json
{
  "order": "Disease"
}
```

Based on the example, I will retrieve the data which will be sorted based on the **'Disease'** in an ascending way.

If you want to sorted in a descending format, you can add `descending` field and set it to true (default is false).

**Data example**

```json
{
  "order": "Disease",
  "descending": true
}
```

`limit` is like its name to limit the number of object you want to retrieve.

**Data constraints**

```json
{
  "limit": "[valid number <int>]"
}
```

**Data example**

```json
{
  "limit": 3
}
```

You can also combine all the parameter like the given example below.

```json
{
  "where": {
    "Disease": ["Fungal infection", "Allergy", "AIDS"]
  },
  "order": "Id",
  "descending": true,
  "limit": 2
}
```

### Success Response

**Code** : `200 OK`

**Content example**

```json
[
  {
    "Description": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight infection and disease.",
    "Disease": "AIDS",
    "Id": 6,
    "Precautions": [
      "avoid open cuts",
      "wear ppe if possible",
      "consult doctor",
      "follow up"
    ]
  },
  {
    "Description": "An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance that's not typically harmful to your body.They can include certain foods, pollen, or pet dander. Your immune system's job is to keep you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens.",
    "Disease": "Allergy",
    "Id": 1,
    "Precautions": [
      "apply calamine",
      "cover area with bandage",
      "use ice to compress itching"
    ]
  }
]
```
